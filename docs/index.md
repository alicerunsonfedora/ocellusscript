OcellusScript is a simple, statically typed, multi-paradigm programming language that takes most inspiration from Java and Haskell, but also takes in other cues from languages like Swift, Python, Kotlin, and JavaScript/ES5. It is designed to be an easy language to use for aspiring developers and easy to implement for developers looking to implement a compiler/interpreter.
