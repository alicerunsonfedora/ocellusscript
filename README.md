OcellusScript is a functional programming language, originally designed to work hand-in-hand with the coding mini game from the Unscripted visual novel. OcellusScript heavily draws inspiration and syntax from languages like Haskell, Swift, JavaScript/ES5, and Python. OcellusScript aims to be an easy-to-use, type safe, and powerful language.

This repository contains the specifications and documentation for the OcellusScript programming language, as well as the source code for Efficacy, the compiler and interpreter for OcellusScript.

> ⚠️ Note: OcellusScript is still a work in progress and is not fully functional as a language yet.
