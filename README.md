> ⚠️ OcellusScript is currently being reworked to better operate as a simple language.

OcellusScript is a simple multi-paradigm programming language modeled after Java and Haskell while combining features from other languages like Kotlin, Swift, Python, and JavaScript. Although designed specifically for the [Unscripted](https://unscripted.marquiskurt.net) visual novel, this language can be used separately with WebAssembly.

This repository contains the primary compiler, written in Kotlin, and the extension for Visual Studio Code.
